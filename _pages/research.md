# Where in the brain do we decide to move?

The Machado lab develops and deploys neural recording techniques to study how circuits across the brain send commands to the brainstem and spinal cord to control movement.

### How do motor command pathways interact to generate specific movements? 

Past studies have shown that many parallel pathways that arise in different regions across the brain are each involved in driving specific movements. But until recently, it was difficult to study how these parallel pathways interact each with other on a moment-to-moment basis to produce behavior. This is because it was not straightforward to simultaneously record from large numbers of neurons in distinct regions. Thanks to recent advances in neural recording technology, we are now able to simultaneously measure the commands sent by different brain areas during different kinds of movements. This lets us study how motor command syntax might change as a function of changing brain state (e.g. with thirst or arousal), or as a consequence of neurodegenerative disease.

# We study brainwide circuits using [brainwide recording techniques](http://timmachado.com/papers/Machado-Kauvar-2022.pdf). 

### Optoencephalography (widefield Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and COSMOS)
We use [COSMOS](http://timmachado.com/papers/Machado-Kauvar-2022.pdf), a single-photon imaging technique to measure neural activity from across the curved surface of mouse dorsal cortex. <br>

### Large-scale electrophysiology (Neuropixels)
We use multielectrode arrays called Neuropixels to simultaneously record from hundreds of neurons.

### Tissue clearing techniques and light sheet microscopy
We use tissue clearing techniques like [SHIELD](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4281) and DISCO to perform whole-brain histology and to reconstruct electrode tracks.

### Analysis of neural population dynamics
We use and develop new algorithms, software packages, and approaches for analyzing the large-scale neural datasets that we collect.
