  bio: I'm interested in understanding how descending pathways command the brainstem and spinal cord to initiate and modify movementsâ€”especially across different brain states (like hunger, thirst, and arousal). Previously, I was a postdoc working in the Deisseroth Lab at Stanford. Before that, I started a company called CTRL-labs that used ideas related to my doctoral work to build non-invasive technologies for decoding motor intention. I went to graduate school at Columbia where I studied spinal motor circuits. Outside of lab, I enjoy running, biking, and trying to be outside.
